This book can be read and enjoyed by anyone who has ever interpreted even a single seismic line, by eager students who aspire to be David and, and by nongeoscientists who presume that they know how David and think.

His first book, 'Seven Beats a Second' was described by one reviewer as 'humerous...compelling and lovable...leaving out the pretentious, the politically correct and memory manipulation.'

The truth is, you need less than you think. You don't need to be a workaholic. You don't need to staff up. You don't need to waste time on paperwork or meetings. You don't even need an office. Those are all just excuses. What you really need to do is stop talking and start working. This book shows you the way.

The Bible says “there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5). “Christ…suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God” (1 Peter 3:18). It also says “God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us….the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 5:8, 6:23).Christ died on a cross and rose from the grave (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). By doing that he bridged the otherwise uncrossable chasm between God and us, providing us the only way to have forgiveness of sin, a personal relationship with God, and eternal life.", "Emily Starr never knew what it was to be lonely—until her beloved father died. Now Emily's an orphan, and her mother's snobbish relatives are taking her to live with them at New Moon Farm. She's sure she won't be happy.

Things begin to change when she makes friends: with Teddy, who does marvelous drawings; with Perry, who's sailed all over the world with his father yet has never been to school; and above all, with Ilse, a tomboy with a blazing temper. Amazingly, Emily finds New Moon beautiful and fascinating. With new friends and adventures, Emily might someday think of herself as Emily of New Moon.", "Almost everything about Wallace is at odds with the Midwestern university town where he is working uneasily toward a biochem degree. An introverted young man from Alabama, black and queer, he has left behind his family without escaping the long shadows of his childhood. For reasons of self-preservation, Wallace has enforced a wary distance even within his own circle of friends—some dating each other, some dating women, some feigning straightness. But over the course of a late-summer weekend, a series of confrontations with colleagues, and an unexpected encounter with an ostensibly straight, white classmate, conspire to fracture his defenses while exposing long-hidden currents of hostility and desire within their community.Real Life is a novel of profound and lacerating power, a story that asks if it’s ever really possible to overcome our private wounds, and at what cost.", "");
