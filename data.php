It contains commentary on both the humorous and serious sides of an David and's day from the point of view of the fictitious David and Sam, our Everyman of interpretation. Sam introduces each chapter with a caricature of himself (an interpretation of his own “reflection,” if you will, created by the talented artist David Carman), and in the epilogue, he offers a special gift to his friends in data processing. This book can be read and enjoyed by anyone who has ever interpreted even a single seismic line, by eager students who aspire to be David and, and by nongeoscientists who presume that they know how David and think.", "Begin your exploration of the Realm with the Core Rulebook for the Talisman Adventures Fantasy Roleplaying Game! Magical forests, treacherous mountains, deadly dungeons, and more await you between these pages.Begin your adventures as any of ten classes (assassin, druid, minstrel, priest, prophet, scout, sorcerer, thief, warrior, or wizard) and seven ancestries (elf, dwarf, human, ghoul, leywalker, troll, and sprite).The Talisman Adventures Fantasy Roleplaying Game is a hardcover book divided into two sections: the Player’s Guide and the Game Master’s Guide. In the back of the book, you’ll find Light and Dark Fate tokens, character sheets, and six pre-gen characters. It also includes a short, starting adventure, Death’s Messenger, so that you can jump right into the action.", "Peter Ash’s friend Lewis has helped him out of jam more times than he can count, and has saved his life more than once. So he doesn’t hesitate when Lewis asks a favor. Lewis has left his criminal past behind, but a former associate may be in trouble, and he and Peter must make a trip to check in on the man. But their visit immediately takes a dark turn when they arrive to find a smoldering cabin. They soon realize that someone has stolen notebooks full of incriminating secrets about Lewis’s long-ago crimes.Lewis and Peter must find the notebooks: They are full of details that not only endanger the family and home that Lewis has built, but place his very life at risk. With June's help, they begin to search. Soon they find themselves up against professional criminals, and the two men may have to tap into the dark sides that they have worked to keep hidden in order to take on particularly ruthless enemies.", "Sixteen-year-old Marnie lives in the idyllic coastal village of Clevedon. Despite being crippled by a childhood exposure to polio, she seems set to follow in her mother's footsteps, and become a dipper, escorting fragile female bathers into the sea. Her life is simple and safe. But then she meets Noah. Charming, handsome, son-of-the-local-Lord, Noah. She quickly develops a passion for him - a passion which consumes her. As Marnie's infatuation turns to fixation she starts to lose her grip on reality, and a harrowing and dangerous obsession develops that seems certain to end in tragedy. Set in the early Victorian era when propriety, modesty and repression were the rule, this is a taut psychological drama in which the breakdown of a young woman's emotional state will have a devastating impact on all those around her.", "Alix Chamberlain is a woman who gets what she wants and has made a living, with her confidence-driven brand, showing other women how to do the same. So she is shocked when her babysitter, Emira Tucker, is confronted while watching the Chamberlains' toddler one night, walking the aisles of their local high-end supermarket. The store's security guard, seeing a young black woman out late with a white child, accuses Emira of kidnapping two-year-old Briar. A small crowd gathers, a bystander films everything, and Emira is furious and humiliated.

His first book, 'Seven Beats a Second' was described by one reviewer as 'humerous...compelling and lovable...leaving out the pretentious, the politically correct and memory manipulation.' This new book is like his first, simple, casual reading for both poetry lovers and those who think poetry is not for them.", "Homie is Danez Smith’s magnificent anthem about the saving grace of friendship. Rooted in the loss of one of Smith’s close friends, this book comes out of the search for joy and intimacy within a nation where both can seem scarce and getting scarcer. In poems of rare power and generosity, Smith acknowledges that in a country overrun by violence, xenophobia, and disparity, and in a body defined by race, queerness, and diagnosis, it can be hard to survive, even harder to remember reasons for living. But then the phone lights up, or a shout comes up to the window, and family―blood and chosen―arrives with just the right food and some redemption. Part friendship diary, part bright elegy, part war cry, Homie is the exuberant new book written for Danez and for Danez’s friends and for you and for yours.", "36 hours ago: A vicious serial killer is arrested on the streets of north London after a two-year reign of terror. Known only as the Night Creeper, he’s earned his reputation by torturing five young women to death.24 hours ago: Undercover cop Sean Egan has infiltrated one of the country’s most notorious criminal gangs. Now he’s about to risk his life in a desperate bid to bring its members to justice.12 hours ago: DI Tina Boyd has discovered that the Night Creeper’s murders are part of a much larger criminal conspiracy. But her quest for the truth has brought her into contact with some very dangerous people who want to silence her—permanently.The last 10 seconds: A man, a woman, a sadistic killer. As they race toward a terrifying confrontation only one thing is certain: when time runs out, not everyone will still be alive.", "The truth is, you need less than you think. You don't need to be a workaholic. You don't need to staff up. You don't need to waste time on paperwork or meetings. You don't even need an office. Those are all just excuses. What you really need to do is stop talking and start working. This book shows you the way. You'll learn how to be more productive, how to get exposure without breaking the bank, and tons more counterintuitive ideas that will inspire and provoke you.With its straightforward language and easy-is-better approach, Rework is the perfect playbook for anyone who’s ever dreamed of doing it on their own. Hardcore entrepreneurs, small-business owners, people stuck in day jobs they hate, and artists who don’t want to starve anymore will all find valuable guidance in these pages.", "To get where you want to go, you first need to know where you are.Though Jesus is God’s sinless Son, he became a human in order to substitute himself in place of us and pay the penalty for our sins. The Bible says “there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5). “Christ…suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God” (1 Peter 3:18). It also says “God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us….the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 5:8, 6:23).Christ died on a cross and rose from the grave (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). By doing that he bridged the otherwise uncrossable chasm between God and us, providing us the only way to have forgiveness of sin, a personal relationship with God, and eternal life.", "Emily Starr never knew what it was to be lonely—until her beloved father died. Now Emily's an orphan, and her mother's snobbish relatives are taking her to live with them at New Moon Farm. She's sure she won't be happy. Emily deals with stiff, stern Aunt Elizabeth and her malicious classmates by holding her head high and using her quick wit. Things begin to change when she makes friends: with Teddy, who does marvelous drawings; with Perry, who's sailed all over the world with his father yet has never been to school; and above all, with Ilse, a tomboy with a blazing temper. Amazingly, Emily finds New Moon beautiful and fascinating. With new friends and adventures, Emily might someday think of herself as Emily of New Moon.", "Almost everything about Wallace is at odds with the Midwestern university town where he is working uneasily toward a biochem degree. An introverted young man from Alabama, black and queer, he has left behind his family without escaping the long shadows of his childhood. For reasons of self-preservation, Wallace has enforced a wary distance even within his own circle of friends—some dating each other, some dating women, some feigning straightness. But over the course of a late-summer weekend, a series of confrontations with colleagues, and an unexpected encounter with an ostensibly straight, white classmate, conspire to fracture his defenses while exposing long-hidden currents of hostility and desire within their community.Real Life is a novel of profound and lacerating power, a story that asks if it’s ever really possible to overcome our private wounds, and at what cost.", "Peter Ash’s friend Lewis has helped him out of jam more times than he can count, and has saved his life more than once.
